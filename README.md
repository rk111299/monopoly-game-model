# monopoly-game-model

The SQL code in this repository was a fun exercise modelling gameplay of the board game monopoly using a relational database. This involved designing the database itself, then creating tables, inserting values, and updating tables using SQL. I also created a trigger to keep track of any gameplay changes and board moves, acting as a automated 'banker'.
